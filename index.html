			<h3>Under 10 (U10)</h3>
			<p>We have entered a U10 team into a league for this season (22/23). The format of the U10 age group is such that we can borrow and lend players to ensure everyone gets ice time, so this was a logical starting point. We have been allocated into a league with Chelmsford, Milton Keynes and Peterborough.</p>
			<h3>Under 12 (U12)</h3>
			<p>The rules in the U12 age group differ, where the requirement to enter a team is 15+1. When submitting our plans for the 2022-23 season, we did not have the numbers to commit to a U12 league team. This does not mean they will go unchallenged; WE have contacted clubs to line up games throughout the season and training will continue as usual.</p>
			<h3>Under 14 (U14)</h3>
			<p>We believe we are in a favourable position to move forward with the older age groups into next season (2023/24). We are keen to maintain interest in this age group and feather the nest for the U12 players moving up to U14 next year. We hope to get the U14/U16 players on the ice sporadically through the season to maintain a presence of our desire to expand.</p></div>
